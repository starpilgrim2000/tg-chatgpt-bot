<h1>Telegram Chatbot with OpenAI Integration</h1>
<p>This is a Telegram chatbot that integrates with OpenAI for generating responses to user queries. The bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API for generating responses and can be configured with various parameters to control the response generation process.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine: <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git</code>.</li>
  <li>Install the necessary dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
  <li>Set your Telegram bot API token and OpenAI API key in environment variables. You can do this by creating a <code>.env</code> file in the project directory and adding the following lines:
    <pre><code>TG_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token-here<br>
OPENAI_TOKEN=your-openai-api-key-here</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Start the bot by running <code>python main.py</code>. The bot should now be up and running and ready to accept user queries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use the chatbot, simply open a conversation with the bot in Telegram and start sending messages. The bot will respond with a generated response based on the message you sent.</p>
<p>Currently, the bot supports the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/start</code>: Sends a welcome message to the user.</li>
  <li><code>/help</code>: Sends a help message explaining how to use the bot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>You can configure the chatbot by changing the following parameters in <code>main.py</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>engine</code>: The OpenAI engine to use for generating responses. The current implementation uses the most powerful engine, <code>text-davinci-003</code>, but you can try out other engines if you want.</li>
  <li><code>max_tokens</code>: The maximum number of tokens in the response. Increase this value to generate longer responses.</li>
  <li><code>temperature</code>: A setting for "creativity" in the response generation process. Increase this value to generate more creative but potentially less accurate responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also modify the code in <code>main.py</code> to add new features or functionality to the chatbot.</p>
